Adds checkboxes to each widget to either show or hide on every site page.

== Description ==

Avoid creating multiple sidebars and duplicating widgets by adding check boxes to each widget which will either show or hide the widgets on every site page. Great for use with Thesis theme, or just to avoid extra coding.

By default, 'Hide on Checked' is selected with no boxes checked, so all current widgets will continue to display on all pages. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `display-widgets.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Widgets' menu and show the options panel for the widget you would like to hide.
4. Select either 'Show on Checked' or 'Hide on Checked' from the drop-down and check the boxes.

== Screenshots ==
